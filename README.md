Principal Investigator: Hohyun Jung (see: https://sites.google.com/view/hohyunjung)

Supported by: Korea Institute of Science & Technology Evaluation and Planning

We aim to analyze media reports and research trends in the field of bio-health. Since COVID-19 has accelerated the transition to a non-face-to-face society, it is necessary to analyze each future scenario in the bio-health field after pandemic. We will learn about the field of biohealth triggered by covid19 using news data and investigate what to prepare for in the post-covid era.
